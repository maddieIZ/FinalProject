							<ul>The <strong>dot-com bubble</strong> (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, and the Internet bubble) was a stock market bubble caused by excessive speculation in Internet-related companies in the late 1990s, a period of massive growth in the use and adoption of the Internet.</ul> 
							<br>
							<ul>The <strong>September 11 attacks</strong> (often referred to as 9/11) were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda against the United States on the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The attacks resulted in 2,977 fatalities, over 25,000 injuries, and substantial long-term health consequences, in addition to at least $10 billion in infrastructure and property damage.</ul>
                            <br>
							<ul>The <strong>Iraq War</strong> was a protracted armed conflict that began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition that overthrew the government of Saddam Hussein.</ul>
							<br>
							<ul>The <strong>Great Recession</strong> was a period of marked general decline (recession) observed in national economies globally that occurred between 2007–2009. The scale and timing of the recession varied from country to country (see map). At the time, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that it was the most severe economic and financial meltdown since the Great Depression.</ul>
							<br>
							<ul>The <strong>Deepwater Horizon oil spill</strong> (also referred to as the <strong>BP oil spill</strong>, oil leak, or oil disaster; the Gulf of Mexico oil spill; and the Macondo blowout) was an industrial disaster that began on April 20, 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico on the BP-operated Macondo Prospect, considered to be the largest marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry and estimated to be 8 percent to 31 percent larger in volume than the previous largest, the Ixtoc I oil spill, also in the Gulf of Mexico.</ul>
							<br>
							<ul><strong>Political Turmoil 2011:</strong> The Arab Spring (Arabic: الربيع العربي‎) was a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions that spread across much of the Arab world in the early 2010s. It began in response to oppressive regimes and a low standard of living, starting with protests in Tunisia (Noueihed, 2011; Maleki, 2011).</ul>
							<br>
						    <ul>Current supply is the total world output of oil. <strong>OPEC</strong> supplies of 60% of the world's oil exports.The United States has cut into its market by extracting shale oil. Between January 2011 and December 2014, U.S. shale oil production quintupled from 1 million to 4.9 million barrels per day. That created an oil glut. By February 2016, traders had sent the price of imported oil down to $29 per barrel.
							As of March 2020, there is a glut of oil. U.S. shale production reached a peak of 8.2 million barrels per day in November 2019. In December, China announced the first case of coronavirus. In January 2020, governments began closing businesses to stem the pandemic. By April, 40% of the world's population had been told to stay at home.
							Instead of cutting supply, OPEC and Russia increased production to maintain market share. As storage facilities filled, prices plummeted into negative territory. No one wanted delivery of oil since there was hardly any place to store it.</ul>
